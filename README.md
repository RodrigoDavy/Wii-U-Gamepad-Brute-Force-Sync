# Wii U Gamepad Brute Force Sync
An Android app to help you sync your Wii U gamepad to your Wii U without a TV
This is useful in the very specific scenario where your Wii U gamepad isn't synchronized with the console and your Wii U isn't able to display an image (either because you don't have a TV or your Wii U video output isn't working)

Built using Android Studio

## Instructions

**Step 1:** Turn on your Wii U and wait around 2~5 minutes to make sure it booted

**Step 2:** While pressing the sync button on the gamepad with the stylus, turn on the gamepad (there should be a menu asking you to insert the code to sync with the Wii U)

**Step 3:** Open this app on your Android phone

**Step 4:** On the Wii U, press sync one time, wait 5 seconds (or more if you want to be sure) and press sync a second time

**Step 5:** Immediately after Step 4, press the start button in the Android app

**Step 6:** Try out the combinations the app gives to you

**Step 7:** The sync menu disappears after 3 minutes, so if the timer turns red, either wait for the timer to run out and give 5~10 seconds just to be sure, or press the sync button (it should make the Wii U go back to the home menu)

**Step 8:**: Reṕeat step 4 to 7 until the gamepad hopefully syncs with the Wii U
